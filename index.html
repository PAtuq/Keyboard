        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This is a web-app built to conduct experiments on the possible benefits of differentiated audio feedback in keyboards.
        </p>

        <ol id="instructions">
            <li>This is a typical typing test, of the type you might find online.</li>
            <li>It will consist of 5 sentences that you must type.</li>
            <li>You will have been asked to begin either using your own, i.e., physical keyboard, or our built-in soft keyboard. If you are participating in our experiment, we ask that you use your physical keyboard</li>
            <li>Read the instructions below, and when ready to begin, click the start button to move to the test page.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Instructions for those participating in our experiment</h2>
        <ol id="experimentInstructions">
            <li>Firstly, read the general instructions above, in the introduction.</li>
            <li>You will have been asked to complete the test under one of four conditions, either: <br></li>
            (A) : Differentiated audio feedback, forward order<br>
            (B) : No differentiated audio feedback, forward order<br>
            (C) : Differentiated audio feedback, reverse order<br>
            (D) : No differentiated audio feedback, reverse order<br>
            <li>If you've been assigned to either "No-differentiated audio feedback" condition, check the "Mute audio feedback" box before starting. Or simply mute your system</li>
            <li>If you've been assigned to either reverse-order condion, check the "Reverse order" box before starting.</li>
            <li>Regardless, you will complete the test once with vision, and once with your vision of the text-input obscured.</li>
            <li>For the first test, "Blind mode" should be unchecked.</li>
            <li>For the second test, "Blind mode" should be checked.</li>
            <li>At the end of a test, you will be provided a summary of your results. Please report this summary to whoever asked you to participate (A screenshot, photo, written recordings of all values... So long as we get it)</li>
            <li>You have finished when you have completed the test twice, once with vision and once in blind-mode, and have reported to us the results. We thank you for your participation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Some important notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The test is not case-sensitive.</li>
            <li>You will have to select, i.e., click the input-box at the very start of this test. You will not have to re-select it for every sentence, just start typing as soon as a new sentence is presented. </li>
            <li>Your speed (WPM) is tracked by a timer. This timer resets as soon as a new sentence is presented. Thereby, you are expected to complete these tests in one burst, without resting between sentences.</li>
            <li>The setting variables are stored in your browser. Thereby, when starting a new test it's possible to carry-over settings from an old test. Between your first (with-vision) and second (blind) tests, close your browser and restart the app.  In a pinch, you can use ctrl + shift + i to see the console, and check/uncheck settings until you get your desired settings. In the console logs, 1 means the setting is enabled, and 0 means it is disabled.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <div class="Settings">
            Blind mode : <input type="checkbox" id="blindSetting" onclick="setBlind()">
            <br>
            Mute audio feedback : <input type="checkbox" id="soundSetting" onclick="setSound()">
            <br>
            Reverse test order : <input type="checkbox" id="reverseSetting" onclick="setOrder()">
        </div>
